If your car is braking when going forward then change the Direction here
Or when using autogears and pressing S to brake kills you engine(Because it thinks it can go into reverse)

Regarding auto gears, make sure the gearspeeds table has the SAME NUMBER as of the gearratios table, youll encounter problems otherwise
Like so: 5 Gears, 5 Speeds

Using UseRPMBasedGear will make your gear always start at 1, so dont set it when not using it
It is only useful whe using AutoGear

Theres no way to refuel currently, i have never used fuel so never bothered to do something about it, might work on something
if people keep pestering me about it, otherwise just reload the e2

Yes you can make a rwd and fwd with awd drivetrain using the powerdistribution
Play with it, you can do things like 20% front, 80% rear

Engine hp and torque are honestly an aproximation, dont take it TOO seriously

If you dont want camera and light controls or you dont have the extra core, disable extra config
Due to reasons I have not automatically enabled the Cam Activated whenever you link it, just link it to
CamOn and youll be good to go

Sport/Confort mode has not been made to drift, so dont expect it to work well or at all for that

AutoGear is a arcade like automatic gear mode
While ClassicAuto is a more realistic one, AutoGear must be on for it to work

If you dont want to manually set gear speeds you can just use UseRPMBasedGear

If you prefer Wire Clutch as brakes, those are an option now, just up the brake force values to match it

This is version has been tested but nonetheless it is still prone to bugs
